# Loyola Website

## Basic guidelines to be followed:
- Follow components, sub-components based coding. Do not have the entire component in 1 file.
- You can add a separate file in the pages folder to test your components.
- Do **not** use raw CSS. Instead use Tailwind CSS, which is installed and you can use along with [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com).
- To get the project on your PC, clone this repository and then run `npm install` to install all the dependencies (make sure you have `node` and `npm` though).
- the use `npm run dev` and the project will be hosted in [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
- Follow the color scheme and design present in the Figma link and guidelines. Do not deviate too much from it. 
- Plenty of documentation and tutorials available on the internet, so make use of them.
- All images and videos (if needed) can be put into either the `/assets` or the `/public` folder (whatever is convenient) .
- Add the following
    ```
    //-------------------------------
    ```
    to separate large groups of code into sections.
    Also add a small description of what you are trying to do in that section
