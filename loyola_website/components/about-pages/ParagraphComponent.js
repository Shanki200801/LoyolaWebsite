      <p>
        Loyola Degree College is a Jesuit university at the heart of Bengaluru, the Silicon city of India.
        Established in 1882 by Paris foreign Fathers, the management of the college was handed over to the
        Jesuit order (Society of Jesus) in 1937.
        <br /><br />
        In the campus of Mount St Joseph, the first educational institution was Loyola School in 1982 for the economically poor
        students of the neighbourhood.
        In 1989, Loyola Primary and Higher Primary schools were established. In 1992, another institution that was added was
        Loyola Industrial Training Institute, where poor students are given training in the fitter trade, motor mechanic, driving, electrical maintenance, carpentry, etc.
        Hundreds of students have been given training to make a living through these trades and have excelled in society.
        <br /><br />
        In 2008, Loyola High School was upgraded to Loyola Composite Pre-University College. Today, the Pre-University College has a strength of 600 students with Science, Commerce, and Arts streams.
        After several years of discernment and discussions, the Jesuits of Karnataka Jesuit Province finally decided to start a
        degree college in the name of their Founder, St. Ignatius Loyola.
        <br /><br />
        The Loyola Degree College started functioning from the academic year 2017-18 with B.Com and BA (Journalism, Communicative English, and Psychology) courses.
        The college is affiliated with Bangalore University. The college is a unit of BANGLORE JESUIT EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY, Jesuit Nivas, Museum Road, Bengaluru â€“ 560025.
        The campus has a spacious building, a large playground with facilities for cricket, basketball, volleyball, and other sports and games.
